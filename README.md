# Hyprland for Fedora 42 (GNOME edition)
**You need install**
- SwayLock
- Swaync
- Hyprland
- Hyprpaper
- Kitty
- Syshud
- Waybar
- Wlogout
- Cava
- Fastfetch
- Rofi (recommended) or Wofi
- Gnome-terminal (because I write it in config file)
- Nautilus (because I write it in config file)

**WARNING**
My build was originally designed for ***Linux Fedora 42 (with GNOME by default)***. That's why I use swaylock instead of Hyprlock. I also have a pretty minimalistic build.:
- rounded corners are disabled
- animations are disabled
- blur is disabled

For shotcuts, see *hyprland.conf*
